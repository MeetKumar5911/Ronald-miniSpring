## üöÄ Key Features

- **IoC Container**: This framework provides a complete implementation of dependency injection and inversion of control, allowing you to manage your application components easily.

- **AOP Framework**: Experience aspect-oriented programming with support for method interception and enhancement, making your code cleaner and more modular.

- **Bean Lifecycle**: Manage the complete lifecycle of beans, including instantiation, initialization, and destruction, ensuring your application runs smoothly.

- **Resource Management**: Utilize a flexible resource loading system that supports both classpath and file system resources.

- **Event System**: Implement the publish-subscribe pattern for application events, allowing different components to communicate efficiently.

- **Type Conversion**: Enjoy a robust type conversion system that handles both basic and custom types seamlessly.

- **XML Configuration**: Benefit from full XML configuration support, complete with namespace handling, making it easier to configure your application.

## üí° Technical Highlights

### 1. IoC Container

The IoC container is the backbone of the Ronald-miniSpring framework. It allows you to define your application components and manage their lifecycle. By using dependency injection, you can create loosely coupled components that are easier to test and maintain.

### 2. AOP Framework

Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) allows you to separate cross-cutting concerns from your business logic. With the AOP framework in Ronald-miniSpring, you can easily define aspects that apply to multiple parts of your application, such as logging or transaction management.

### 3. Bean Lifecycle Management

Managing the lifecycle of beans is crucial for resource management. The Ronald-miniSpring framework handles the complete lifecycle, from instantiation to destruction. You can define initialization and destruction callbacks, ensuring that your resources are managed efficiently.

### 4. Resource Management

The resource management system allows you to load resources from various locations, including the classpath and file system. This flexibility makes it easy to manage configuration files, images, and other assets your application may need.

### 5. Event System

The event system in Ronald-miniSpring implements the publish-subscribe pattern, enabling different components of your application to communicate without being tightly coupled. This approach enhances the modularity and maintainability of your code.

### 6. Type Conversion

Type conversion is essential when dealing with different data types. The Ronald-miniSpring framework includes a robust type conversion system that can handle both basic types (like integers and strings) and custom types you define.

### 7. XML Configuration

Configuration is a critical aspect of any framework. Ronald-miniSpring supports XML configuration, allowing you to define beans, properties, and other settings in a clear and organized manner. The framework also supports namespace handling, making it easier to manage complex configurations.

## üìñ Usage

Once you have set up the Ronald-miniSpring framework, you can start using its features in your application. Here are some basic examples:

### Example 1: Defining a Bean

To define a bean in XML configuration, create a file named `applicationContext.xml`:

```xml
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
       http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

    <bean id="myBean" class="com.example.MyBean">
        <property name="property1" value="value1"/>
    </bean>

</beans>
```

### Example 2: Using Dependency Injection

In your Java code, you can retrieve the bean from the IoC container:

```java
ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("applicationContext.xml");
MyBean myBean = (MyBean) context.getBean("myBean");
```

### Example 3: Aspect-Oriented Programming

To define an aspect, create a class annotated with `@Aspect`:

```java
@Aspect
public class LoggingAspect {

    @Before("execution(* com.example..*(..))")
    public void logBefore(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
        System.out.println("Before method: " + joinPoint.getSignature().getName());
    }
}
```
